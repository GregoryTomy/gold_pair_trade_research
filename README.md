*NOTE: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY*
A linear mean reverting pairs-trading strategy.
We use tickers GLD and GDX. GLD versus GDX is a good candidate for pair trading because GLD reï¬‚ects the spot price of gold, and GDX is a basket of gold-mining stocks. It makes intuitive sense that their prices should move in tandem.
